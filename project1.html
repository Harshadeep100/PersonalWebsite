        ● Pioneered a computer science web development project in the Full stack development field, where I worked independently to add different features to a website. The goal was to improve the web interface, usability, user interface, landing pages, UX/UI design systems, cross-browser compatibility, and scalability.<br>
        ● Efficiently Worked on the creation of an Automatic Search Query feature using the CI/CD pipeline and achieved accurate results with the ability to work independently.<br>
        ● Successfully implemented code reviews, peer programming, and requirements for both frontend and backend development features from both the client and server sides by working in SCRUM.<br>
        ● I adeptly incorporated REST APIs to seamlessly retrieve and showcase data from databases, enhancing the overall functionality of the application.<br>
        ● Used web design tools like HTML, SAAS, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, Node.js, jQuery, React.js, REST APIs integration, version control systems GIT, and GitHub to gain web application development insights to obtain the system and application performance of this feature.<br>
        ● Resourcefully, used Vue.js, Spring Boot, and AngularJS Frameworks in the project.<br>
