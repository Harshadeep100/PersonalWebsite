        <font size="+2">Deep Learning Project</font>(Aug 2023 - Dec 2023)<br>
        ● Spearheaded a deep learning project using Rational approximation by replacing polynomial approximation, particularly for accurate estimations of nonsmooth and non-Lipschitz functions.<br>
        ● Efficiently optimized, using the best uniform rational approximation that provides a fast and efficient method for calculating the best approximation.<br>
        ● Applied the approximation as a preprocess step to deep learning classifiers and demonstrated that the classification accuracy is significantly improved compared to the classification of the raw signals.<br>
        ● This approach has been tested on various functions, including nonsmooth and non-Lipschitz, and applied to deep learning, resulting in significantly improved classification accuracy.<br>
        ● Orchestrated a Docker-based environment for the deep learning project, ensuring consistent and reproducible setups across development, testing, and deployment phases.<br>
        ● Created and optimized Docker images tailored for deep learning frameworks, enhancing performance and facilitating resource-efficient model inference.<br>
        ● Integrated Docker containers seamlessly into the CI/CD pipeline, automating testing and deployment processes for efficient and reliable project delivery.<br>
        ● Implemented Dockerized rational approximation as a preprocessing step to deep learning classifiers, resulting in a substantial increase in classification accuracy, especially for nonsmooth and non-Lipschitz functions.<br>
